**<h2>Dyscalculia Detection Web Application</h2>**

This web application is designed to detect the likelihood of dyscalculia in children through a series of assessments.
Parents or teachers can create accounts, add multiple children, and take the dyscalculia test. The test has three stages: a questionnaire for the parent or teacher, a series of mathematical questions for the child, 
and a whiteboard session to assess arithmetic and place value understanding. Upon completion, a detailed report is generated, including questionnaire results and visual graphs. 
The report can be shared with doctors for further analysis and feedback.
